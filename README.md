# B-Tree vs. AVL-Tree
Non fine-tuned implementations of B-Tree and AVL-Tree and a comparison of the time taken by them. 

The B-Tree test program runs atleast 3-4 times faster than AVL-Tree (similar amount of data, 10000000 nodes) even when it is not fully optimised.

**Cache performance** and **avoidance of malloc overhead** major reasons for better performance.
